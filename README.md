# 🐍 Python Projects – GIAIC Journey

Welcome to our collection of Python projects developed as part of our learning journey through the GIAIC program. These projects are categorized into three progressive stages, each building on the skills and concepts acquired in the previous one.

## 🚀 Project Stages Overview

### 📘 Stage 1: Python Basics  
In this foundational stage, we focused on understanding Python syntax, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic programming constructs.

### 🧠 Stage 2: From Basics to Intermediate  
This stage included a mix of basic and intermediate-level projects, including working with files, exception handling, modules, and creating small but functional Python programs.

### 💼 Stage 3: Real-World Projects  
The final stage was focused on applying our skills to real-world applications. These projects were built using **Streamlit** for web-based apps or **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for terminal-based tools. This phase was all about turning code into interactive, user-friendly tools.
